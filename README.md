# Pokémon Emerald

This is a personal project of Pokémon Emerald decompilated by [pret](https://github.com/pret) which includes many feature branches from the [ROM Hacking Hideout](https://github.com/rh-hideout) community, and so on.

The original source builds into [pokeemerald.gba](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1961) `SHA1: f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7` readily; to set up a copy of the repository [look here](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
