# Pokémon Emerald

This is a personal fork of the Pokémon Emerald disassembly by [PRET](https://github.com/pret) which includes many feature branches from the [ROM Hacking Hideout](https://github.com/rh-hideout) community, and so on.

The original source code builds into [pokeemerald.gba](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1961) readily; you can see an [updated changelog](https://github.com/mausprz/pokeemerald/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) of this project, or set up a clean installation from the [master repository](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
